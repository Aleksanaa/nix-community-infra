#### Role

The role of the administrators is to support the members of the org, and the Nix project in general.

#### Responsibilities

The administrators are responsible for serving the community to the best of their ability and availability.

They provide services such as:

- keep the systems updated and patched
- reply to user requests
- host new services that could help the project
- on-board new projects
- resolve conflict

The administrators are the only "owners" of the github organization.

#### Quorum of 5 rule

To reduce the attack surface on the project, the administrative team size is limited to 5 people.
