[@nix-community][nix-community] is a GitHub organization that works alongside the [@NixOS][NixOS] organization.

The [@NixOS][NixOS] organization holds all the mission-critical projects such as Nix, Nixpkgs, NixOps, Hydra, etc.

The [@nix-community][nix-community] organization is the community playground. We don't need to be as strict with permissions. The org can host any projects that benefit from a shared ownership. We provide infrastructure and support for those projects as well as visibility.

## Infrastructure and services

To support our activities we have a little bit of infrastructure in place, see [services](./services.md). The configuration is kept in [nix-community/infra](https://github.com/nix-community/infra).

## Sponsors

Thanks to all our sponsors.
